# ACNH Lighthouse : App in your hand

## A Guide to Animal Crossing New Horizon

This app provides useful information and data to assist users playing 'Animal Crossing New Horizon' on Nintendo Switch.
I myself have spent copious amount of time to find the details of certain items, villagers and general what-to-do's with my phone, and some of them led to spending too much time in navigating to access the information I needed.

In general, this app provides these features, but not limited to:

- Search for information about in-game objects including items, villagers, quests
- Save and show my last search result
- UI to save current turnip price from Monday to Saturday
- Expect to suggest possible highest/lowest turnip price throughout the week with entered data
- Update page that shows the latest update and seasonal events along with past events.

The app is a personal hobby app and is in its development stage.

The final goal is a working deployable Progressive Web App, where users can access to my website and use the app in his or her own smartphone, that works just like a native app from the Appstore or Playstore.
